# -AWS-EC2-Provisioners-Lab-Terraform-
In this lab, I learned how to provision an EC2 instance with Terraform, create and attach an SSH key pair, install Nginx using user data, work with provisioners, and create &amp; associate an Elastic IP. I also learned how dependency chains work and how Terraform determines which resources depend on which.
